# Ryan Raidt's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website project! This site was created as part of my learning journey in web development at Fullstack Academy. It includes an introduction to who I am, what Iâ€™m learning, and my growing portfolio of projects.


## Overview
This website is my first project as I learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as both a portfolio and a personal site to introduce myself. I plan to expand and improve it as I continue learning.

## Pages

The **Index** page (`index.html`) serves as the homepage of my site. It includes:
